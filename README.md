Data cleaning and feature engineering :
The methods used include data cleaning and feature engineering, where duplicate rows were dropped and data types were changed to improve the analysis.

Data Visualization :
Data visualization methods such as bar plots, histograms, pie charts, line plots and heatmaps are used to represent the insights.

Additionally, the project also analyzes the effect of lead time, room type and distribution channel on bookings and revenue, and trend of bookings within a month and types of customers making the bookings.

These types of charts are used to effectively communicate and present the data in a way that is easy to understand and interpret for the audience.
